How to replicate the Pogo/Albert databases on a separate computer then use that computer for the source PMT tag data in Viper

1. Copy MTS_Master from pogo to computer.
2. Copy MT_Main from database server computer (albert) to your own.
3. Update MT_Main->V_DMS_Mass_Correction_Factors to return bogus values:
	ALTER VIEW dbo.V_DMS_Mass_Correction_Factors
	AS SELECT -1 AS Mass_Correction_Tag, -1 AS Mass_Correction_ID
4. Set the states of the databases on your local computer to 5. Replace the states of all the other databases to 100. Do this by changing values in MT_Main->T_MT_Database_List. 
5. Add your local computer as a server in MTS_Master->T_MTS_Servers. Set its active state to 1. Disable the active states of the other computers. (Do you really need to disable the states of the other servers?).
6. Delete and readd mtuser as a user on the mass tag database that was restored and has Database role memberships of public, db_datareader, DMS_SP_User.
7. Change FAXA.init file in the VIPER program folder and change the Provider field in MTS Master Database section so that the field Data Source is the local computer: 
	[MTS Master Database]
	Provider=sqloledb;Data Source=wd37552;Initial Catalog=MTS_Master;User ID=MTUser;Password=mt4fun
