It is suggested that you uninstall any old versions of VIPER before installing this software.
In addition, you are required to have ICR-2LS installed prior to installing VIPER.  
It is suggested that you have the 1/3/2005 version (v3.33) of ICR-2LS installed (available from \\floyd\software\ICR-2LS).

To install, double-click the VIPER.msi file (not the VIPER01.cab file).  Follow the default installation prompts.

After installation, you can run VIPER.  If you get an error that the software cannot connect to ICR-2LS, 
then you probably are not using the 1/3/2005 installation of ICR-2LS.  

The powerpoint file VIPER_HelpFile_v3.20.ppt contains useful screenshots and notes on the use of VIPER for data 
visualization and database searching.  Please contact Matthew Monroe (376-2616) if you have problems installing this software 
or if any runtime errors (crashes) occur.  Please contact either Nikola Tolic (376-3090) or Matthew Monroe about usage of the 
software or with suggestions on improvements.
