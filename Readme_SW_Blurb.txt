VIPER (Visual Inspection of Peak/Elution Relationships) can be used to 
visualize and characterize the features detected during LC-MS analyses.  
It is primarily intended for processing deisotoped data from high mass 
measurement accuracy instruments (e.g. FT, TOF, or Orbitrap) and comparing the 
features found to a list of expected peptides (aka mass and time (MT) tags), 
as practiced by the AMT Tag approach (see Zimmer, Monroe, Qian, & Smith, 
Mass Spec Reviews, 2006, 25, 450-482).  The software allows one to display the 
data as a two-dimensional plot of spectrum number (i.e. elution time) vs. mass.  
It can read MS data from several file formats: .PEK, .CSV, .mzXML, and 
.mzData.  See the Readme.txt file installed with VIPER for additional details 
on the various file formats. VIPER runs on Windows computers and requires 
Microsoft Access be installed to create and edit the MT tag databases.  
In order to view mass spectra from raw data files (e.g. Finnigan .Raw files, 
you will also need to install ICR-2LS (available at http://ncrr.pnl.gov/software/).
